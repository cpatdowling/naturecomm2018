daily_loads: contains average hourly block-face occupancies calculated from SDOT
             transaction data for Q2 of 2016; row number corresponds to the alphanumeric
             index order of block-face element keys specified in ekeys_2016Q2.pck,
             columns are left-binned hours e.g. 9:00 AM occupancy is the average occupancy
             over 9:00-9:59 AM.
rej_rates_localuniform_fixservice_2016Q2: three file types per day (effective_arrivals,
                                          rejections, and true_arrivals) by hour. row
                                          number corresponds to the alphanumeric index
                                          order of block-face element keys specified 
                                          in ekeys_2016Q2.pck, columns are left-binned hours
                                          e.g. 9:00 AM occupancy is the average occupancy
                                          over 9:00-9:59 AM. Values are inter-arrival times
                                          in minutes (inverse of occurences per minute)

ekeys_2016Q2.pck: serialized (pickle) numpy array of integer blockface elementkeys
                  element keys are unique integer id's used by SDOT
loads_2016Q2.pck: serialized (pickle) numpy array of shape (256, 72), where each row
              corresponds to an element key in ascending order. Each column corresponds
              to a hour and day, beginning with Monday and ending Saturday, for 8 AM to 8 PM
supplies_2016Q2: rows are block-faces by element key, columns are dates in header
                 values are the supply of available parking spaces as reported by SDOT
dailysupply_modes_2016Q2: rows are element key in ascending order, values are the mode
                          of the supplies_2016Q2 values across days, used in calculating rejection
                          rates, 13 of the 256 undergo a supply change due to closure or
                          reallocation of space in Q2 of 2016
out_degree_distribution: a length 256 csv numpy array of outbound block-face connections per block
                         lower bounded at 1 for block-faces that lead out of Belltown
ekeytolatlong_2016Q2: serialized python dictionary, values are two pairs of 
                      latitude/longitude coordinates that denote the endpoints by
                      the element key of block-face
belltown-blockface-accessibility: a csv of block-face element keys. The first value
                                  of each row is the ``origin'' block-face, while
                                  any following values are block-faces that can be 
                                  reached by a driver using legal manuevers
                                  no values implies no immediately connected block-faces
                                  notes on block-face follow the list delimited with #
