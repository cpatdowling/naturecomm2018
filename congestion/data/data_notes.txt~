                 values are the supply of available parking spaces as reported by SDOT
dailysupply_modes_2016Q2: rows are element key in ascending order, values are the mode
                          of the supplies_2016Q2 values across days, used in calculating rejection
                          rates, 13 of the 256 undergo a supply change due to closure or
                          reallocation of space in Q2 of 2016
out_degree_distribution: a length 256 csv numpy array of outbound block-face connections per block
                         lower bounded at 1 for block-faces that lead out of Belltown
