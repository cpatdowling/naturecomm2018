Executing the script congestion_and_time_delay.py from the src directory will 
generate all figures found in Nature Communcations publication "Fusing multiple
data streams to control urban congestion caused by drivers searching for 
curbside parking" pertaining to congestion and travel time delay.

The script must be executed from /naturecomm2018/congestion/src locally since 
relative filepaths are used.

For code used to generate the estimates of volumes of drivers searching for 
parking consult github.com/cpatdowling/net-queue for matlab code implementing
the polynomial equations found both in this publication and the associated
"Optimizing curbside parking occupancy subject to congestion constraints" 
IEEE CDC 2017 conference publication.
